# Bot Battlr - React Application Code Challenge

## Welcome

Welcome to **Bot Battlr**, the ultimate destination in the known universe for building your personalized Bot Army! As a galactic web developer, you've been commissioned by a powerful overlord to create a web app that allows them to explore a catalog of robots, view detailed information about each robot, and enlist them into their formidable army.

## Instructions

For this code challenge, you will be building a React application that interacts with a local server running a JSON DB. Your goal is to follow the instructions provided below and showcase your ability to implement the features while demonstrating a clear understanding of the given requirements.

## Requirements

1. **Well-Written README File**: You are required to provide a comprehensive README file that details the setup, features, and any other relevant information about your project.

2. **Fetch Data from Local Server**: Utilize a local server running a JSON DB to fetch data for your application. Instructions for setting up the server are provided below.

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Create a new project folder.

2. Create a new private GitHub repository. Ensure that your TM (Teaching Mentor) is added as a contributor for grading purposes. Rest assured, your code is secure.

3. Regularly commit your changes to the repository to track your progress.

4. In your project directory, create a `db.json` file and use the provided [data](#) for your server DB.

5. Run the following command to start the backend server:

   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json
    ```
6. Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:

    ```bash
    http://localhost:3000/bots
    ```
